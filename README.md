# between-
I can almost avoid the problem, by setting the windows 10 scale and layout to 100%, re-logging in and then setting the scale to 200% which will then allow the video to play correctly, so I am thinking there may be an issue with some thing in the dll which is overriding the display settings if it thinks they are no longer on the desktop window.  I am aware that this UDF is old, and is probably no longer the best way to do video playback, however it does some nice things, which I am yet to figure out using other methods. _ I am very open to advice on the best way to play videos using new systems in Windows 10.  Currently I play multiple videos, on multiple windows, cross fading between them I also use the Engine_SetRects to choose which part of the artwork to show on which screen.
